                    This site represents an online tool dedicated to the discovery of various music related information.
                    The site is based on the premise that the song is the basis of all music and thus the aim of this
                    tool is to search for new songs based on user given preferences and to give new insights to the user
                    about the record's authors, genera, type, history and associations.
                </p>

                <h2>User flow</h2>
                <p>
                    From a user's standpoint he or she will be able to do a number of actions, each one with an associated
                    page. The following sub chapters will be placed in order and describe a general user flow.
                </p>
                <section id="LoginRegister">
                    <h3><span>1.</span> Login\Register</h3>
                    <p>
                        To gain access to any utility from the music recommendation tool a user must first register or
                        login to the site. To do this the user will be prompted to enter his or hers email and password.
                        If the authentication succeeds the user will remain logged in until a certain time expires or the
                        logout option is pressed. In the logged in state the user will now be granted access to the tool's
                        utilities.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section id="Playlist">
                    <h3><span>2.</span> Playlist Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        A logged in user will now be able to see his/hers available playlists. On this page they can
                        create a new playlist, delete a playlist or select a playlist to begin the process of searching
                        for new songs to add to the respective list or they can chose to remove songs from it. Another
                        option that is now available to the user on this page is the ability to share a selected playlist
                        with friends via an online social platform.

                    <p>
                        On this page the user will be presented with a text-box were he\she will be able to type a
                        request in normal natural language (preferably in english) in which various statements and
                        suggestions can be made regarding the songs and musics they want to receive. These requests
                        will be then sent to the server which will then process them and provide the user with a list
                        of songs accompanied by various information regarding them, like their artists, history genera
                        and more. A user can then chose to add these songs to their playlist or they can chose to discard
                        the results and send over a new request.

                <section id="WebServer">
                    <h3><span>1.</span>.Net Core Web Server</h3>
                    <p>
                        The visual part of the application will be handled by a MVC server written in .NET Core. This part
                        will be responsible with delivering the web pages, scripts, forms and more to the end user. Furthermore
                        the server will also handle the authentication part for users that only register with an account made
                        specifically for the use of the online tool. For users who chose to log in with another account, such as
                        a google account or facebook, the server will only check for the user's validation token, before
                        processing the request. The last main job of the web server will be to collect user inputs, organise
                        them and then make specific calls to the necessary end points exposed by a Python Processing Server.
                        Once the awaited response arrives the web server will pass it to the user in a more readable and
                        understandable manner and once the user decides to save his or her playlist, the changes will be
                        recorded in a NoSQL Database available to the server in a RDF compatible format.
                        Note:The changes saved by an user will influence further search results in the selected playlist.

                <section id="PythonProcessorServer">
                    <h3><span>2.</span>Python Processor Server</h3>
                    <p>
                        The main part of the online tool is that of the processor server. Here end points are exposed for
                        the web server to access. Data received on those end points will be processed from natural language
                        into machine data and a list of search patterns will be formed. The server will then proceed to
                        further call upon SPARQL endpoints to gather data based on the search parameters given. Once the
                        queries have returned the data, the python application will then proceed to comb through for
                        the most relevant information based on the context given and then package that data to be sent
                        back to the web server.
                        Note: Due to the high amount of strain and the long duration of the SPARQL search querries this
                        server will likely be replicated.
