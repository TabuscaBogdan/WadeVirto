                    This site represents an online tool dedicated to the discovery of various music related information.
                    The site is based on the premise that the song is the basis of all music and thus the aim of this
                    tool is to search for new songs based on user given preferences and to give new insights to the user
                    about the record's authors, genera, type, history and associations.
